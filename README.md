Chirp is a web application that replicates a Twitter-style comment section. 
You can visit this website through this link: chirp-neon-six.vercel.app

Key features and functions: Mimic a Twitter-style comment space; Allow users to post anything after signing in, Visit other users' profiles by clicking on their usernames, and view specific posts by clicking on the timestamps. Facilitate page rendering speeds, avoid loading state to improve user experience.

 The application has been built using T3-stack(Next.js, TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, Tailwind CSS, NextAuth.js)

Other useful tool I applied: Clerk(Middleware), Vercel (Deployment), Axiom (Manage data), Planet Scale(Database).
